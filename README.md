## Plants store app

This project has been made as an personal case study to explore vanilla web technologies and some motion design experimentation.

- handlebars has been used to split html templates

The layout, concept and visual identity has been made by the wonderful RVBR Team (https://www.instagram.com/rvbr_design/). i've designed and applied the animations layer in the project.
